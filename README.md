# Calculator app for flutter application devvelopment

## This is an app created for Cal Poly Pomona CS4750 Winter 2023.

This is a new Flutter simple calculator application using dart math expression solver.
This is a very simple and straight to the point application that is not really too complex or intricate, but it is still very functional and the best one could create in the timespan given for this project with absolutely no experience in application development.

The task is to create an application that solves a problem. This new app that serves as a tool for anyone in need of a calculator but does not possess one. With this app downloaded, anyone can just simply pull out their phones whenever they need to quickly calculate any mathematical problems! Definitely easier than having to do the math in your head and humiliate yourself if you get it wrong!
